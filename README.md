# Piano Experiments

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks with audio experiments about the piano.

I started out with the idea of building a piano sampler in Python. I analyzed a single piano tone, which I then synthesized to see if I could get a convincing representation. I thought the results were meaningful, but the exploration provoked more questions which I continued to explore in more notebooks.

I use tools from Allen Downey's book about digital signal processing, *Think DSP*. His code is available on GitHub.

The piano sample comes from a Steinway B-211 sampled by KaleidonKep99 on GitHub.
