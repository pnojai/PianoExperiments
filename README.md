# Piano_AnalysisSynthesis_FirstTray

I want to see if I can build a piano sampler in Python. I want to take a recording of a single piano note, run a Fourier analysis on it to determine its spectrum, and then synthesize an audio wave by applying the Fourier coefficients to sinusoids. I think that is called a Fourier Representation. If I get a meaningful result, then I want to extend that Fourier Representation to neighboring pitches and see how far I can go from the original pitch and still sound credble.
